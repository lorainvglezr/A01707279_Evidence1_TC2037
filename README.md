# Context and Description
The chosen language for this first evidence is the "Chakobsa language" which is a fictional language created by the famous science fiction writer called Franklin Patrick Herbert Jr., better known as Frank Herbert, for his famous 1965 novel "Dune", and its five sequels. This language is mainly related to the Fremen society, who were the desert-dwelling people of the planet Arrakis. Chakobsa is not only a way of expressing or communicating between individuals, this fictional language is also very valuable beacuse of its reflection of the culture and the environment of its speakers, emphasizing their connection to the harsh desert landscape. 
#### Key Vocabulary in Chakobsa
For this evidence, will be taken into account just a few words that are derived from this Chakobsa language. The words to be used are:
- **Kala:** This word can be translated to *'desert'* and it encloses the vast and arid landscapes that the Fremen describe as home on Arrakis.
- **Karama:** This term means *'miracle'* and is borrowed from the Ishkal language, highlighting the cultural connections in Herbert's universe.
- **Kaveh:** This word refers to *'coffee'* an essential beverage that signifies the importance of trade and sustenance in the Fremen way of life.
- **Kaymun:** This term denotes *'sand finely ground sand like powder'*, this highlights the unique environmental conditions of Arrakis, where such fine sand predominates.
- **Ketman:** This concept represents *'the practice of concealing the identity when revealing it might be harmful.'*, especially when revealing it could pose a danger, reflecting the Fremen's instinct for survival in a hostile world.
These words associated to the narrative of *Dune* do more than just tell a story, these words can also give us a glimpse into the values and experiences of the Fremen people. This really shows how language can both shape and mirror a culture.
